# Bizi

## Description

Bizi "We know you are!"

	Idea:

		Bizi is a digital business card app.  Users can log in to their own profile and input their contact/personal info and generate a digital business card to share with other colleagues and clients. Just feed the app your name, contact info, job title, company, and a short message about yourself and Bizi does the rest.  Changed jobs? Update your Bizi card.  No more waiting for paper cards.  People move and switch jobs all the time.  Why not have a card that's just as flexible as todays job market?

	User Story:
		
		As a user, I want to be able to create an account so I can log in to use Bizi

		As a user, I want to be able to save my credentials, so I don't have to input my username and password everytime.

		As a user, I want to be able to reset my password if I forget it.

		As a user, I want to see an error message if I enter an incorrect user name and/or password

		/////////////////////////////////

		As a user I want to be able to add my personal info to Bizi 

		As a user I want to be able to add a picture of myself to Bizi
		
		As a user I want to be able to add my job title and place of employment to Bizi.
		
		As a user I want to have the option to edit my business card after it's built by Bizi

		As a user I want to be able to save, edit, and delete my digital business card.

		As a user I want to be able to share my business card with others by linking it to a QR code.

- Motivation:  Job hopping is the new norm in today's working world.  Likewise, digital applications are a wonderful tool to save time and money.
Bizi is our answer to quickly build, edit, save and download a digital business card for personal use. 

- Why did you build this project? All members of our group are currently learning a brand new set of skills and an application like Bizi would be a great tool for us to use after we gradute and seek new job opportunites.

- What problem does it solve? It is both a time saver and a convenient place to build and store a business card. Why waste time and money designing and ordering new paper business cards whenever you get a new job or earn a new title/position?  No more reaching for a paper card in your wallet and forgeting that you left them at home.

- What did you learn?
