# resuME

## Description

ResuMe "build yours!"

	Idea:

		resuME is a resume builder app.  Users input their personal info, a headshot (if they want), work history, and references; 
			and resuME does the rest. Users can create and save multiple resumes to access, edit, download/upload, or delete at anytime. 

	User Story:
		
		As a user, I want to be able to create an account so I can log in to use resuME

		As a user, I want to be able to save my credentials, so I don't have to input my username and password everytime.

		As a user, I want to be able to reset my password if I forget it.

		As a user, I want to see an error message if I enter an incorrect user name and/or password
